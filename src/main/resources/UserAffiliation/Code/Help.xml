  &lt;p&gt;This page allows CTA authors to change their signature and affiliations for
    papers managed by SAPO.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Change of signature&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Authors can choose change the name used by SAPO using the &lt;b&gt;FIRST NAME&lt;/b&gt; and
    &lt;b&gt;LAST NAME&lt;/b&gt; fields. Unicode characters can be used as desired.
    The author's signature, which will be used to CTA papers, is shown in the
    &lt;b&gt;SIGNATURE&lt;/b&gt; field. The signature comprises the initials of the first name(s),
    and all of the second name(s)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For example, with
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;FIRST NAME&lt;/b&gt;="Alpha-Beta Gamma", and&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;LAST NAME&lt;/b&gt;="delta Epsilon Zêta-Eta"&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    the author's signature would be
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;"A.-B. G. delta Epsilon Zêta-Eta".&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can also supply your ORCID id (as a URL) if you wish this to be added
    to you signature for journals that accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Change of affiliations&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Authors can manage their affiliations by selecting the institutions
    they are affiliated with in the fields at the bottom of the page. All authors
    can specify a primary and secondary affiliation from the database maintained
    by SAPO. Exceptionally, authors can request SAPO add a third affiliation
    by contacting SAPO by email and explain the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the &lt;u&gt;address for your affiliation is not correct&lt;/u&gt;, please
    click on the address to see the entry for this affilation, and contact the
    &lt;b&gt;MANAGER&lt;/b&gt; listed on the page to request it be changed, or SAPO if no
    manager is given&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;u&gt;if your institution is not present&lt;/u&gt; in the list, please contact
    SAPO by email and explain the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
